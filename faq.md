#FAQ: Prodo Parser

**Question:** What is Prodo?

**Answer:** Prodo is a simple, feature-light, imperative programming language with strong typing and readable syntax. It blends our favorite features from languages like C, Python, Ruby, Java, and Javascript.

**Q:** How do I use the parser?

**A:** The Prodo parser is a simple command-line tool that runs on Python. After installing dependencies, enter one of the following commands (depending on your configuration) from the Prodo parser's directory:

    python parser.py myfile.prodo

For more information about using the Prodo parser, please see the [user manual](https://github.com/prodo-team/prodo/blob/master/prodobigay_manual.pdf).

**Q:** How does the parser work?

**A:** All compilers and interpreters work essentially the same. They look at some code, find out what it _means_ and translates into _something_. That _something_ might be machine code, some lower-level language, or direct instructions.

The Prodo parser works by using an LL parser that was generated by [YAPPS](http://github.com/smurfix/yapps). The parser translates Prodo code into Python code. The Python code is **compiled** using the _compile_ function and the resulting code object is then **executed** using the _exec_ function.

So Prodo isn't just heavily influenced by Python--this implementation is also heavily dependent on it.

**Q:** How was the parser made?

**A:** The parser was generated by YAPPS from a file called [prodo.g](https://github.com/prodo-team/prodo/blob/master/prodo.g), which is actually included in the release. This file is a combination of EBNF (for the grammar rules), Python regular expressions (for tokens), and Python code (for conversion).

**Q:** Where do I find the built-in subprograms?

**A:** Prodo comes with some built-in functions like _write_, _read_, _length_, and a few others. They are written in Python in the file [prodo.py](https://github.com/prodo-team/prodo/blob/master/prodo.py). This file also contains some utility functions used internally. For example, _assign_() is used to facilitate type checking during assignments.
